    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ricotta cheesecake is a delightful variation of the classic cheesecake, where creamy ricotta cheese replaces some or all of the traditional cream cheese. This Italian-inspired dessert offers a lighter texture and a slightly tangy flavor profile compared to its cream cheese counterpart. Combined with eggs, sugar, and often a hint of vanilla or citrus zest, ricotta cheesecake bakes into a smooth and velvety filling with a subtle richness. It's typically baked on a buttery crust, adding a delightful contrast in texture. Served chilled, topped with fresh fruit, compote, or a dusting of powdered sugar, ricotta cheesecake is a luscious and elegant dessert that beautifully showcases the creamy goodness of ricotta cheese.</p>
